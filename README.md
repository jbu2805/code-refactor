# code-refactor
##Description

I hope that this activity will help me to understand better the connection between HTML and CSS and develop a better understanding of semantic HTML elements. It was exciting to learn the relationship between section and article and how to shorten the CSS section by applying styles to a group of elements. I have tried my best to make the code neater and all images accessible.
